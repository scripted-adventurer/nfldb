    """
    Represents a single play in an NFL game. Each play has an
    assortment of meta data, possibly including the time on the clock
    in which the ball was snapped, the starting field position, the
    down, yards to go, etc. Not all plays have values for each field
    (for example, a timeout is considered a play but has no data for
    `nfldb.Play.down` or `nfldb.Play.yardline`).

    In addition to meta data describing the context of the game at the time
    the ball was snapped, plays also have statistics corresponding to the
    fields in `nfldb.stat_categories` with a `nfldb.Category.category_type`
    of `play`. For example, `third_down_att`, `fourth_down_failed` and
    `fourth_down_conv`. While the binary nature of these fields suggest
    a boolean value, they are actually integers. This makes them amenable
    to aggregation.

    Plays are also associated with player statistics or "events" that
    occurred in a play. For example, in a single play one player could
    pass the ball to another player. This is recorded as two different
    player statistics: a pass and a reception. Each one is represented
    as a `nfldb.PlayPlayer` object. Plays may have **zero or more** of
    these player statistics.

    Finally, it is important to note that there are (currently) some
    useful statistics missing. For example, there is currently no
    reliable means of determining the time on the clock when the play
    finished.  Also, there is no field describing the field position at
    the end of the play, although this may be added in the future.
